## 💭 About Me:

I'm an avid gamer that enjoys pushing my creativity to new heights! Because of my interest in gaming and in tech, I decided that programming would be a great path for me. I enrolled in UCLA's Coding Bootcamp back in 2020 and completed the course in 2021. Since then I've been self-studying and using freelancing as a method to sharpen and improve my skills. 

My course in UCLA has provided a solid foundation and understanding for <b> Full Stack </b> development. Additionally I learned from the bootcamp <i>(and from self-teaching)</i> that gaming has prepared me for programming, how you might ask? Well, like Portal, it's spending copious amounts of time problem sovling! 🥴😵

I've got two ambitions:

1️⃣ Become a 💻 software developer 💻 for a company and work towards a more interactive tomorrow

2️⃣ Develop a 🎮 video game 🎮 <i>(or two)</i> that people can enjoy
